                    A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.
                    This placement helps readers comprehend your argument.
                    To see how, try this: find an academic piece that strikes you as well written and go through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph.
                    You should be able to easily follow the sequence of logic.
                    When you’re writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences first because they usually convey your own original thinking.
                    It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.
                    For the most part, a text reads smoothly when it conveys a thoughtful and well organized argument or analysis.
                    Focus first and most on your ideas, on crafting an ambitious analysis.
                    The most useful guides advise you to first focus on getting your ideas on paper and then revising for organization and word choice later, refining the analysis as you go.
                    Thus, consider the advice here as if you already have some rough text written and are in the process of smoothing out your prose to clarify your argument for both your reader and yourself.
